- # Scope
	- Interest organisation => _How are Interests stored?_
	- Interest matching => _Which interests are similar/equal?_
- # Structuring interests
	- ## Overall structure
		- Interests and hobbies are **difficult to structure**
		- Interests are not a list {{cloze because there are many terms for the same interest across multiple languages}}, but a cluster of interest terms.
			- Example: _Coding_, _Programming_, _Software Development_, _Hacking_ are all ^^terms for the same activity/hobby^^
