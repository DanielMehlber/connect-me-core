- But first, read our [[How-To-Develop]] page. There you'll find all goals and rules we set ourselves in order to develop a great app 📖📱
- # What we use 💻
	- The Frontend (App that you can download on your phone) is written in **Flutter** {{cloze an cross platform app framework that runs with native speed on any device. That means we can develop an app once and run it everywhere 🔥}} and **Dart** 🎯 {{cloze a programming language that runs almost everywhere and is similar to Java}}
	- The Backend (Server) is written in **Java** ☕ using the **Spring Boot Framework** and Maven {{cloze for building and testing our server}} .
	- We also use Docker {{cloze a container management system that helps us deploying and testing the server backend}} and Git(-Hub)
	- You can develop in any IDE you want, this technology stack is very flexible 🎈
